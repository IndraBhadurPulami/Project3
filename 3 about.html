    <h2>About</h2>
<p>Front Exterior - aim for the most attractive angle(s), and get a mix of daytime, sunset/dusk, and night</p>

<p>Hotel Lobby - with and without front desk colleagues</p>

<p><pre>        Rooms - shoot every room category, if possible. Get a “hero” shot showing the full space, as well as details like the view, work area, and bedside. Don’t forget the bathrooms!</pre></p>

Another option is to engage a past client (and their photographer), and ask if you can use the professional photos from a real wedding at your property.</p>

<p>Dining - <big>at minimum, aim for a few wide “hero” shots of your F&B outlets and some attractive shots of your standard menu offerings. You may want to also get an appealing photo of your in-room dining offering.</big></p>

<p>Spa - if you have a spa, grab some “hero” shots and some detail photos of specific offerings like the massage area, beauty treatments, or sauna.</p>

<p>Pool<sub>SWIMMING POOL</sub> - resort<sup>200 rooms aviable</sup> amenities like a pool or beach access are particularly great to shoot from above with a drone!</p>

<p>Other Amenities - this list could go on! The important thing is to capture what makes your property unique and attractive to potential guests.</p>
